# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health factors using a machine learning model. It features a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their health information and receive a prediction.

## Features

- **Predictive Model:** Utilizes a trained machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to predict the risk of heart disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for users to input their health data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data cleaning and preparation before feeding it to the model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn 
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing health-related information (e.g., age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.) and corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.


## Usage

1. Access the web application in your browser.
2. Enter your health information in the provided input fields.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive a prediction.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore different machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate more advanced visualization techniques.
- Deploy the web application for public access.
- Add features for personalized recommendations based on predictions.
