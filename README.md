# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health factors using a machine learning model. It features a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their health information and receive a prediction.

## Features

- **Predictive Model:** Utilizes a trained machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict the risk of heart disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for users to input their health data.
- **Interactive Visualization:** May include visualizations to display prediction results and insights (optional).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data cleaning and preparation before feeding it to the model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (or other machine learning libraries)
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing health-related information (e.g., age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.) and corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The dataset source should be cited here (e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset).


## Usage

1. Access the web application in your browser.
2. Enter your health information in the provided input fields.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive a prediction.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore different machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate more advanced visualization techniques.
- Deploy the web application for public access.
- Add features for personalized recommendations based on predictions.
